Operational intelligence
----------------------------------
Operational intelligence (OI) is a category of real-time dynamic, business analytics
that delivers visibility and insight into data, streaming events and business
operations. Operational Intelligence solutions run queries against streaming
data feeds and event data to deliver real-time analytic results.
          Operational Intelligence provides organizations the ability to make decisions and
immediately act on these analytic insights, through manual or automated actions.

The purpose of OI is to monitor business activities and identify and detect situations relating
to inefficiencies, opportunities, and threats and provide operational solutions.
Some definitions define operational intelligence an event-centric approach to
delivering information that empowers people to make better decisions.

Complex Event Processing(CEP)
---------------------------------------
Event
----------------------------
An event can be defined as "a significant change in state"
    An event is an action or occurrence recognised by software that may be handled
by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the system,
by the user or in other ways.

Distributed computing?
-----------------------------------------
 A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers
 communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact
 with each other in order to achieve a common goal.

 What is distributed in Distributed Computing?
 --------------------------------------------------
 The word distributed in terms such as "distributed system", "distributed programming",
 and "distributed algorithm" originally referred to computer networks where individual
 computers were physically distributed within some geographical area. Something which is
 present not in same place physically or virtually.

 Cluster Computing:
 ----------------------
 A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers
 that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system.

Dedicated Server
-------------------------
 A dedicated server is a type of remote server that is entirely dedicated
 to an individual, organization or application.

 Scalability
 ----------------------------
 Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing
 amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.
 For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output
 under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.

 In other words, Scalability is the ability of a program to scale.
 For example, if you can do something on a small database (say less than 1000 records),
 a program that is highly scalable would work well on a small set as well as working
 well on a large set (say millions, or billions of records).
